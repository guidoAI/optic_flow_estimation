    "# Optic flow estimation from an image pair\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explain how to estimate optic flow from an image pair coming from a conventional camera. There are many different optic flow algorithms, ranging from exhaustive block-matching to variational methods, and from phase-based methods to deep neural networks. However, in our explanation, we will focus on the most common, CPU-based, _feature-based method_ that performs two steps:\n",

    "    <LI> Feature tracking </LI>\n",
    "</OL>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will start with the second step, as it is the one that actually determines the optic flow. In particular, we will explain the method developed by Lucas and Kanade [1], which is both a fast and accurate method for determining optic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lucas and Kanade's algorithm for optic flow determination\n",
    "In their article, Lucas and Kanade first explain their method with a one-dimensional example. We will do the same here. Below, we show two curves, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which only differ by a horizontal shift, i.e., $g(x)=f(x+h)$, where $h$ is the the horizontal shift. The vertical axis is termed $I$ for illuminance. The fact that the curves have the exact same illuminance shows that it constant brightness is assumed. \n",

    "<IMG SRC=\"LucasKanade_flow.png\" WIDTH=\"50%\"></IMG>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have:\n",

    "g(x) = f(x+h)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\">(Eq. 1)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis for the Lucas and Kanade method is a linear approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\">(Eq. 2)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "where we can use equation 1 to arrive at:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f'(x) \\approx \\frac{g(x) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\">(Eq. 3)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "and by re-arranging terms:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "h \\approx \\frac{g(x) - f(x)}{f'(x)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\">(Eq. 4)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Eq. 4 is the basic step in the Lucas and Kanade algorithm. Explained on an intuitive level: If function $g$ is higher at $x$ than $f$, and $f'(x)$ is positive, then $h$ should be augmented in order to shift $f$ further to the left to better match $g$. Similar reasonings can be follow for $g$ being lower than $f$ and $f'(x)$ being positive or negative. Both the underlying math and the intuitive explanation immediately show that this method strongly relies on local approximations.\n",

    "1. Please have a look at the code. Halfway the code, you will find a variable `x_query`, which is now set to 3. If you run the code, you will see that the optic flow estimated at that location corresponds quite well to the ground truth value of 0.5. Set `x_query` to different values. Try to make the algorithm fail. Under what conditions does it fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now change the function properties. Can you make a function for which the method will always fail? And a function for which the estimate will always be wrong when the shift is bigger than a given threshold? What do these situations correspond to, if the function values correspond to actual pixel values in a real image? "

A uniform image area would lead to no change and an edge only when shifting orthogonally to it. A corner would lead to the largest intensity changes when shifting the window around.

    "1. The worst outcome happens at $x= 0$, where $f'(x) = 0$. If the actual gradient $\\frac{\\delta f}{ \\delta x}$ were used, it would lead to a division by 0. Also, when $f$ and $g$ intersect, the shift will be estimated as $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When selecting a linear function with a 0 slope, $f'(x) = 0$ and the estimate is always wrong (actually leads to a division by zero in the current code). This corresponds to a uniform texture in the image (e.g., part of a white wall). When selecting the `sine_slope` function with 0 slope, shifts bigger than half the period will lead to wrong estimates. This corresponds to repetitive texture in images. Even when adding a slope, like of 0.5, the method will start to estimate the wrong direction when surpassing the threshold, due to the local minima in the function."
